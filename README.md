**Intro**    
  
This is a project that showcases the hometowns of some of Practicum's employees. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. This is the third project of the Web Development program at Practicum by Yandex. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on a figma draft.
